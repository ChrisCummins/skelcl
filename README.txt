SkelCL is a multi-GPU skeleton library based on OpenCL. It is actively
developed at the University of Münster, Germany, by Michel Steuwer and
others. For comments or questions feel free to contact the author:
michel.steuwer@uni-muenster.de

Most of the functionality is explained in detail in the following
peer-reviewed publications:

 - M. Steuwer, S. Gorlatch, S. Buß, and S. Breuer:
   Using the SkelCL Library for High-Level GPU Programming of 2D Applications
   in Euro-Par 2012: Parallel Processing Workshops, 2012, Rhodes Island,
   Greece (to appear)

 - M. Steuwer, P. Kegel, and S. Gorlatch:
   Towards High-Level Programming of Multi-GPU Systems Using the SkelCL
   Library in 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed

Two key abstractions are made in this library: algorithmic skeletons
and a unified memory abstraction. This also reflects in the classes
described here. The Skeleton class and subclasses describe
calculations performed on a GPU.
The Container classes, like Vector provides a unified memory management
for CPU and GPU memory.
