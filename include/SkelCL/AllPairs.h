/// The AllPairs skeleton will compute the results of all two pairs of the row
/// and column-vectors from the matrices and store them in a result matrix.
/// More formally: When M and N are two matrices of dimension height x dimension
/// and dimension x width. Then D is the result matrix of dimension height x width.
/// Every D[i,j] is the scalar result from either Reduce(Zip(M_i, N_j)) or
/// UserDefString(M_i, N_j), where M_i is the ith row in M and N_j is the jth column in N.
